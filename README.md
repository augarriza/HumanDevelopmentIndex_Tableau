# A visual approach to the Human Development Index (HDI) and the impact of Education
Ironhack Berlin DTFT 0320_module2_data visualisation project_Tableau

## Overview
My intenton with this project is to use visualizations to move the focus away from flags, rankings and statistics into the people who endure the reality those statistics aim at protraying.

## Work/Obstacles
The Kiva Crowfunding data set was already clean and well organised so I didn´t find any obstable regarding the preparation of the data. However I did spend some time checking it´s 84 columns and thinking what my story could be.
After importing the data on Tableau I did encounter some  obstacles: 
I.I wanted to divide the countries into 4 bins according to their HDI index, however I couldn´t set the sizes of each bin so they would match the four officla tiers. I decided then to use color.
II. I wanted to show the evolution in some indicators. However, instead of having a column with dates, my set had a different column for different points in time. When plotting, the visualization did not work as expected so I had to use side-to-side bars. Not the same but it works.
III. On the slide where I emphasize the disparity in population between countries (6:1/2 slide) my initial idea was to remove the 6 most populated countries but leaving the space the empty space surrounded by all the other countries. I thought that was a more powerful visualization.That would have also allowed me to keep the HDI-color scale as in the other slides. However, I didn´t manage so I had to create a set and use color not to indicate the HDI but the "partition" of global populatio in two halfs.

## Conclusions
As shown by the visualizations, there is a clear positive correlation between education and income per capita and more important, life expectancy. I also found particulary interesting to see in a clean, plain graph that life expectancy is higher the smaller the educational gap between male and female.
